# Variations of Softmax

The softmax function is a commonly used activation function in neural networks, particularly for classification tasks. It allows us to map probabilistic distributions using neural networks by transforming a vector of K real numbers into a probability distribution of K possible outcomes. However, the softmax function can become computationally expensive when the number of classes is large, causing slower training and evaluation times.

## Problem Statement

In this project, my goal is to explore different variations of softmax implementations in neural networks and evaluate their impact on model performance and training time. Specifically, I will develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on the CIFAR 100 dataset for image classification. I will compare the standard softmax implementation with alternative softmax functions that reduce the computational complexity.

## Project Tasks

1. **Dataset**: I will use the CIFAR 100 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 100 classes. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **Model Development**: I will design a CNN model with a specific architecture for image classification. The initial model will use the standard softmax implementation as the activation function.

3. **Alternative Softmax Implementations**: I will create a second model with the same architecture as the initial model, but with different softmax implementations that reduce the computational complexity. Examples of alternative softmax implementations include Gumbel-Softmax, and Heirarchical Softmax. I will report the time complexity for each of the softmax functions used.

4. **Model Evaluation**: I will evaluate the performance of both models using a range of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. This will allow us to compare the performance of the models with different softmax implementations.

5. **Performance and Epoch Time Comparison**: I will compare the performance and epoch time between the models with different softmax implementations. This analysis will help us understand the trade-offs between model accuracy and computational complexity.

## Conclusion

By conducting this experiment, we aim to gain insights into the trade-offs between different softmax implementations in neural networks, particularly in the context of classification tasks with a large number of classes. Understanding the impact of softmax implementations on model performance and training time will enable us to make more informed decisions when designing and training neural networks for classification tasks.

This project will not only provide a deeper understanding of softmax variations but also contribute to the broader field of machine learning by exploring techniques to improve the computational efficiency of softmax functions.
